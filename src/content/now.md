This is a [Now page](https://nownownow.com/about), a movement by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now). It’s become widely [adopted by many people](https://nownownow.com/), including [Jenxi](https://jenxi.com/now), my partner at [RubyCoded](https://rubycoded.com/). I last updated this page on the 11th of May, 2025.

## Dataswyft

I’m currently the Merchants Manager at [Dataswyft](/joining-dataswyft), focusing on the [Eat2Give programme](https://dataswyft.com/network-news/eat2give-checkd-data-wallet-campaign).

## Growing RubyCoded

Jenxi and I started RubyCoded a good 10 years ago. We’ve evolved a lot since then, but as technology changes, we’re now making improvements to the technology who have to deploy, along with an increased focus on growing together with the businesses that we support.

## Building Communities

I’m currently building communities at [SubangFood](https://www.facebook.com/groups/subangfood) and [The Subang Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/subangorg).

I’d love you to explore these communities.

## Going back to web fundamentals

I lost my way in web development over two decades ago, and to bridge things, I’ve been using WordPress as a middle ground to get things done.

I’ve decided to go back to the fundamentals of system administration and web development. Dreaming of a simpler web with more pure HTML and CSS.

As it’s now 2024 and the WordPress community is being divided by a [Mad King](https://world.hey.com/dhh/open-source-royalty-and-mad-kings-a8f79d16), the timing couldn’t be better to see [Rails 8 released](https://rubyonrails.org/2024/11/7/rails-8-no-paas-required) and a doubling down on the single person framework and [majestic monoliths](https://signalvnoise.com/svn3/the-majestic-monolith/).

Whether I’m catching the trend at the right time or not, this is my current line in the sand.

_PS: On the topic of majestic monoliths, I’ve always had a thing for_ [_Crenshinibon_](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Crenshinibon)_._

## Digital Gardening

I started a [digital garden](/garden), with just a seedling.

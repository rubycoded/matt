The issue of addiction to our digital devices isn’t new, and I got a [reminder today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC0JKAN5xVI) when I was listening to YouTube in the background.

I’ll eventually get around to writing about digital addiction, but in the meantime, I thought the better way to approach it, would be to actually focus on celebrating the beauty of boredom.

Somehow being bored has turned into a bad thing. We’re always doing our best to cram a podcast episode in, or doom scroll, just to avoid being bored.

Instead of fighting boredom, what if we embraced it?

## Let your mind wander

One of the beautiful things about being bored, is that I allow my mind to wander and go to strange places. Sometimes I don’t feel like going there, but when it’s quiet, and there is nothing to do, you can release your mind, and it finds these magical places. Sometimes it’s a dark cave, sometimes it can be a wonderful world, akin to discovering Narnia.

It could be a bit of my [INTP personality type](https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality) showing, but I thoroughly enjoy my regular mind adventures.

Who knows what you’ll find. All I know is, cramming my brain full of digital dialogue forces my mind into a classroom stupor, rather than letting it roam freely.

## Give it a try

The next time you feel bored, resist the urge to scroll. Let your imagination run wild instead. You might be amazed at that you discover through your imagination.

title: "On being wrong"

I love a good debate. In my free time, I enjoy watching videos online on debates about various topics. There is something about the depth of discussions, the battle of wits, quick thinking, and the reality that often you'll have to agree to disagree, which makes me view it as another kind of sport.

That being said, while I enjoy a good debate myself, and I do play devil's advocate just for exercise, I often come across as argumentative and difficult. In reality, I'm just trying to explore all the possibilities of the situation so that I can further improve. In fact, when I'm debating a matter, often I'm hoping that I will lose, because I actually like being wrong, because that means I gain access to a new perspective, and can look at things and life in a different way.

I like [this article by DHH](https://world.hey.com/dhh/i-love-being-wrong-862e5ef5), one of the [people I try to learn from](https://themattchung.com/people/), on how he loves being wrong.

If you subscribe to the [Six Thinking Hats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Thinking_Hats) framework, you'll probably put me down as regularly wearing a black hat, though I rotate between the hats often.

The Six Thinking Hats is a framework for parallel thinking that encourages looking at problems from different perspectives. Each 'hat' represents a different mode of thinking:

1. **White Hat**: Focuses on available data and facts.

3. **Red Hat**: Explores emotional reactions and intuitions.

5. **Black Hat**: Examines potential risks and drawbacks critically.

7. **Yellow Hat**: Considers benefits and positive aspects optimistically.

9. **Green Hat**: Generates creative ideas and alternative solutions.

11. **Blue Hat**: Manages the thinking process and ensures all hats are used.

There is also the concept of _Strong Opinions Loosely Held_ that [Jenxi](https://jenxi.com/why-blog/), [Devon Zuegel](https://devonzuegel.com/page/about-me), and many others subscribe to.

The "Strong Opinions Loosely Held" mindset is about striking a balance between conviction and flexibility. It suggests that we should:

1. **Form strong opinions**: Develop clear, well-thought-out views based on the best information available. This involves critical thinking, research, and careful consideration.

3. **Hold them loosely**: Be open to changing these opinions when presented with new data, perspectives, or compelling counterarguments. This requires intellectual humility and a genuine commitment to truth-seeking.

I expect to be wrong on many other matters in life and in business, but I truly enjoy the learning and growth that comes from it.

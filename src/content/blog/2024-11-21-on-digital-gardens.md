I’ve been enjoying online digital gardens for a while and never got around to starting my own. However when browsing the [Bear Blog discovery feed](https://bearblog.dev/discover/), I recently came across a post by Brandon lamenting about the challenge of [finding the authentic web](https://brandons-journal.com/finding-the-authentic-web/), which resonated with me, reminding me that it was time to write this, and to start curating my own digital garden.

Perhaps on some level I’m learning from my father who loves gardening, and since I’ve always felt a native to digital, I’ll do my gardening in bits and bytes.

Let this post be the first seed in my digital garden.

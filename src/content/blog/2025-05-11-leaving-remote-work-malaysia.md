It seemed like just yesterday that I was sitting in the car service centre prodding at my laptop and deciding to send Wan Xin a ‘hey, bro’ message as a stranger to find out more about this Facebook group that she had founded called [Remote Work Malaysia](https://www.facebook.com/groups/remoteworkmalaysia). A quick check on our message history shows me that first message was actually back in June 2023. Time flies.

Since then, the community we co-founded has grown to over 92,000 members. 

Just a few days ago I was having a cup of coffee at King’s Hall Cafe, which was the place where we had our first Remote Work Malaysia gathering, so that brought many memories back. The first one is always extra special, as we had no track record to start with, and you never really know if anybody will show up. But members did show up, and we had a great time, and the gatherings have since become one of the community’s key activities.

It’s been an amazing journey, and through I’ve learnt so many things and met so many wonderful people through the community. Through all the learnings of growing the Remote Work Malaysia community, I’ve since founded [the SubangFood community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/remoteworkmalaysia), and also [joined Dataswyft](https://themattchung.com/joining-dataswyft/) in a remote work position.

Now as I want to continue evolving the SubangFood community and nurture other community projects in Subang Jaya, I’ve made the choice that I needed to increase my focus on Subang-based initiatives, and decided to step out from Remote Work Malaysia.

I look forward to seeing the continued positive growth of the Remote Work Malaysia community under the leadership of Wan Xin and her team.

I am especially grateful to Wan Xin for taking a chance with that unknown stranger who just decided to say ‘hey bro’.

Thanks bro.

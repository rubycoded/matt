Most people know the saying ‘don’t cry over spilt milk’, and I’ve recently encountered my own literal version of it. 

I’d transported a box of 12 UHT milk cartons. When I got home, I left the milk in my car boot for two days. A quick search suggested that wasn’t worth the risk to consume it, so that was money down the drain. 

Lesson learnt: keep perishables somewhere more visible in the car.

The kicker? I'd never let my family drink it, and my lactose intolerance complicates matters even if I risked it myself.

I’ll just have to accept the hit and move on. At least I’ve coined my own mantra: Don't cry over spoilt milk.

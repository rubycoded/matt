What is the purpose of a community to you? I see many folks impressed with the size of a community and equate it to the success of a community. However, that may not always be the case. While size matters, its importance is often overstated.

One of the missions I had for one of my communities was to _build community through food_. It wasn't about getting a thousand people connected with another thousand, even a single new connection was considered a success, and I would deem the community to have served its purpose. Fortunately, now it really is connecting thousands upon thousands.

This success is evident in everyday interactions. The other day, as I was sitting opposite people who were strangers to each other not too long ago, but are now laughing at each other's jokes, I was happy to see the community growing in the right direction. I consider the laughs and smiles I see on the faces of community members to be a measure of success. It's about the impact on the lives of people in the community.

Whether you're thinking about joining or building a community, I strongly suggest you spend time deliberating on its purpose. Ultimately, this purpose will guide the direction of the community and serve as a point of alignment for its members.

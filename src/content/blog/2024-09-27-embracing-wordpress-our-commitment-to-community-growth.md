With the recent debates in the WordPress ecosystem, Jenxi and I have had long discussions at [RubyCoded](https://rubycoded.com/about/) and have been reflecting on the importance of community support and growth.

We believe that now, more than ever, is the time to rally behind the WordPress community and contribute to its continued success.

## Our contribution to the WordPress Community

We're launching a new initiative aimed at expanding the WordPress community and welcoming new members. We’d like to invite folks who are currently using platforms like Shopify, Wix, Magento, or having any issues with websites, to transition to WordPress – at no cost for the migration and redesign.

### What We're Offering

- **Free Migration**: We'll handle the entire process of moving your site from your current platform to hosting your new WordPress site with us.

- **Complimentary Redesign**: We will review your current site and provide a fresh, WordPress-optimised design at no additional charge.

- **Expertise and Support**: Leverage our decades-long experience in the industry to ensure a smooth transition.

## Why WordPress?

WordPress powers over 40% of the web, and for good reason. Its flexibility, extensive plugin ecosystem, and strong community support make it an excellent choice for businesses of all sizes.

By joining the WordPress community, you're not just getting a website – you're becoming part of a vibrant, supportive network of developers, designers, and business owners.

## Our Approach: Growing Together

At RubyCoded, we believe in fostering long-term partnerships. While we're offering the migration and redesign at no cost, we do charge for ongoing management and hosting. Here's why this approach benefits everyone:

1. **Quality Hosting**: We partner with Cloudways to provide top-tier hosting solutions, ensuring your site remains fast, secure, and reliable. We’ve been proud to be their partner and [case study](https://www.cloudways.com/en/resources/case-studies/rubycoded) for many years.

3. **Ongoing Support**: We will be there to manage updates, security, and any issues that arise, allowing you to focus on your business.

5. **Cost Optimisation**: Thanks to Jenxi being based in Shenzhen, China, [our sourcing business](https://sourcing.rubycoded.com) can also help optimise your overall costs without compromising on quality.

## More Than Just a Service

Our intention is about getting to know you and growing together. By choosing to work with us, you're not just getting a website; you're gaining a partner committed to your success.

Jenxi and I have been working together remotely for over 10-years, and having our presence in Malaysia and China allows us to offer unique solutions that go beyond typical web services.

## Join Us in Supporting WordPress

If you think your website should do much more for your business or simply want to explore your options, let's work together to strengthen the WordPress community and help your business thrive.

Get in touch today to learn more about how we can support your transition to WordPress and contribute to the growth of this incredible community.

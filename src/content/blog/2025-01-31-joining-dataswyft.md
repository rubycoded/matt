I’m happy to announce that I’ve joined Dataswyft, a distributed company with a mission to [unlock the value of data](https://dataswyft.com/about-us).

Those of you who regularly read the newsletters that I’ve been sending out over the last year might notice that I place a lot of importance on user data, ensuring that the necessary permissions are granted before I send an email to you, and ensuring that readers can withdraw their permission. Dataswyft is taking data privacy to a different level, and I look forward to being a part of that change.

The first version of the [Eat2Give campaign was launched](https://dataswyft.com/network-news/eat2give-checkd-data-wallet-campaign) in collaboration with the [SubangFood community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/subangfood) to showcase the utility of the Dataswyft [CheckD data wallet](https://dataswyft.com/checkd) and [put Subang Jaya on the OpenCommons website](https://opencommons.org/CheckD_Data_Wallet:_Eat2Give).

I look forward to working with the team to improve the next version of Eat2Give from within.
